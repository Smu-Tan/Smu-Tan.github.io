Research on Machine Translation &#10073; Multilingual NLP &#10073; Deep Learning.

I am currently a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://ivi.uva.nl/research/language-technology-lab-ltl.html">Language Technology Lab</a>, <a href="https://ivi.uva.nl">University of Amsterdam</a>. I work with <a href='https://ivi.uva.nl/research/language-technology-lab-ltl.html'>Christof Monz</a> and my amazing colleagues at LTL. Before my PhD, I obtained an M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence at <a href='https://www.uu.nl/en'>Utrecht University</a>, Netherlands, and a bachelor's degree in Information Science at <a href='https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/'>Shandong University</a>.

I'm on a quest to make Machine Translation and LLMs more effective, breaking down language barriers and connecting people around the world! My recent research focuses on understanding and improving Multilingual, Multi-Task Learning, Translation Evaluation, and Multilingual Reasoning. I am always open to collaborations, paper discussions, shared tasks and competitions, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaomutan/">feel free to reach out</a>!
